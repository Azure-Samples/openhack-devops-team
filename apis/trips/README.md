# Overview

This is the Trips API for the MyDriving service.

The server was generated by the [swagger-codegen]
(https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project.  
By using the [OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification) from a remote server, you can easily generate a server stub.

## Running the server

To run the server, follow these simple steps:

```shell
go run main.go
```

## Testing

To run unit tests, execute:

```shell
go test ./tests
```

To run all integration tests, execute:

```shell
go test
```

> Note: this requires an actual database connection, so the required ENV variables need to be present.
