# Overview

This is the Trips API for the MyDriving service.

The server was generated by the [swagger-codegen]
(https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project.  
By using the [OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification) from a remote server, you can easily generate a server stub.

## Running the server

To run the server, follow these simple steps:

```shell
go run main.go
```

## Testing

* To run unit tests, execute:

  ```shell
  go test ./tripgo -run Unit
  ```

To run all integration tests:

* Add a file called .evn to the tripsgo folder with the following structue:
  ```shell
  SQL_SERVER="<-- your database server uri -- >"
  SQL_PASSWORD="<-- your login password -- >"
  SQL_USER="<-- your login user -- >"
  SQL_DBNAME="<-- your database name -- >"
  SQL_DRIVER="mssql"  
  ```
  You shouldn't need to change the SQL_DRIVER variable.
* Execute:
  ```shell
  go test ./tripsgo
  ```

> Note: this requires an actual database connection, so the required ENV variables need to be present.
